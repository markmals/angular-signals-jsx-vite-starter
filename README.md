# Angular Signals JSX Starter Kit

![Angular Signals JSX logo](./src/assets/angular-signals-jsx.svg)

Angular Signals JSX is fine-grained reactive JavaScript framework which uses the signals found in `@angular/core`. This implementation provides considerably better performance than pairing Angular's signals with their dirty-checking Zone.js change detection methods.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command           | Action                                       |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------------- |

| `npm run dev`     | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`  |
| `npm run format`  | Formats all files in the project             |
